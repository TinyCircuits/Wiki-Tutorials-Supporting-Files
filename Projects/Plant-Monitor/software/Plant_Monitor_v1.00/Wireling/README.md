# TinyCircuits Wireling Arduino Library

This library allows for easy use of the various Wireling adapter boards. Provides basic functions for using the PCA9544A I²C multiplexer, and power switching. 

For more information on Wirelings, visit [TinyCircuits.com](https://tinycircuits.com/). 

## Basic Example

A WirelingScanner.ino example is included that demonstrates how to scan for I²C devices on each Wireling port, as well as print the state of the analog pins included with each port.
